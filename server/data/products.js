      'Quand la sonnerie a encore retenti, que la porte du box s est ouverte, c est le silence de la salle qui est monté vers moi, le silence, et cette singulière sensation que j ai eue lorsque j ai constaté que le jeune journaliste avait détourné les yeux. Je n ai pas regardé du côté de Marie. Je n en ai pas eu le temps parce que le président m a dit dans une forme bizarre que j aurais la tête tranchée sur une place publique au nom du peuple français',

      'كتب الدكتور علي الوردي هذا الكتاب فصولاً متفرقة في أوقات شتى وذلك بعد صدور كتابه "وعّاظ السلاطين" وهذه الفصول ليست في موضوع واحد، وقد أؤلف بينها أنها كتبت تحت تأثير الضجة التي قامت حول كتابه المذكور، وقد ترضي قوماً، وتغضب آخرين. ينطلق الدكتور الوردي في مقالاته من مبدأ يقول بأن المفاهيم الجديدة التي يؤمن بها المنطق الحديث هو مفهوم الحركة والتطور، فكل شيء في هذا الكون يتطور من حال إلى حال، ولا رادّ لتطوره، وهو يقول بأنه أصبح من الواجب على الواعظين أن يدرسوا نواميس هذا التطور قبل أن يمطروا الناس بوابل مواعظهم الرنانة.',

      'When asked simple questions about global trends - why the world s population is increasing; how many young women go to school; how many of us live in poverty - we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers. In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and a man who can make data sing, Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens, and reveals the ten instincts that distort our perspective. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.',

    description:
      'Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell s nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff s attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell s prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.',

    name: 'Humankind: A Hopeful History',
    author: 'Rutger Bregman ',

    description:
      'From the author of Utopia For Realists, a revolutionary argument that the innate goodness and cooperation of human beings has been the greatest factor in our success If one basic principle has served as the bedrock of bestselling author Rutger Bregman s thinking, it is that every progressive idea -- whether it was the abolition of slavery, the advent of democracy, women s suffrage, or the ratification of marriage equality -- was once considered radical and dangerous by the mainstream opinion of its time. With Humankind, he brings that mentality to bear against one of our most entrenched ideas: namely, that human beings are by nature selfish and self-interested. By providing a new historical perspective of the last 200,000 years of human history, Bregman sets out to prove that we are in fact evolutionarily wired for cooperation rather than competition, and that our instinct to trust each other has a firm evolutionary basis going back to the beginning of Homo sapiens. Bregman systematically debunks our understanding of the Milgram electrical-shock experiment, the Zimbardo prison experiment, and the Kitty Genovese "bystander effect." In place of these, he offers little-known true stories: the tale of twin brothers on opposing sides of apartheid in South Africa who came together with Nelson Mandela to create peace; a group of six shipwrecked children who survived for a year and a half on a deserted island by working together; a study done after World War II that found that as few as 15% of American soldiers were actually capable of firing at the enemy. The ultimate goal of Humankind is to demonstrate that while neither capitalism nor communism has on its own been proven to be a workable social system, there is a third option: giving "citizens and professionals the means (left) to make their own choices (right)." Reorienting our thinking toward positive and high expectations of our fellow man, Bregman argues, will reap lasting success. Bregman presents this idea with his signature wit and frankness, once again making history, social science and economic theory accessible and enjoyable for lay readers.',
